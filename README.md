# ML Pipeline for Matrix Data Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that implement a complete pipeline for analyzing matrix-structured data using machine learning techniques.

## Contents

- **`join_matrix_new.ipynb`**  
  Loads and combines input matrices, performs initial data cleaning and preparation.

- **`stat.ipynb`**  
  Full data analysis including:
  - Feature preprocessing: normalization, log transformation, standardization
  - Outlier detection: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF
  - Dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE, LDA, NCA
  - Model training: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression, and others
  - Evaluation: metrics, cross-validation, feature importance
